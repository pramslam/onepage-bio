            I discovered editing video games when I played Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. I made maps with the provided editor, but in 1998, my world was blown wide open with Starcraft and StarEdit.

           My first real taste in game development was with StarEdit. I spent my youth setting triggers, tweaking gameplay, and testing hundreds of versions of my maps on the horde of Starcraft players.
